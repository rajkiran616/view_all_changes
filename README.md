# view_all_changes

With this script it is possible to view all commited changes that were made to a specific file.
It is important to specify the full qualified path of that file and of course it has to be in a git repository.

It is important that you have configured a difftool (like P4Merge) before executing this script.

Example: ./vac.sh /full/path/in/git/repo/file.txt
